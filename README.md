Short Description of My Project
This project is a modern, responsive, single-page landing page designed for a fitness brand named "BodyShape." The primary goal of the website is to attract and inform potential clients by showcasing the gym's core offerings in a visually engaging way.

The page features a sleek, dark-themed design with vibrant orange accents to create an energetic and professional atmosphere. Key sections include a dynamic hero banner, an overview of services with clear icons, subscription-based pricing plans, profiles of the gym's trainers, and a "Why Join Us?" section highlighting unique benefits. The entire layout is built to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
